# Vanis.io - the worst of the worst
Feel free to submit fixes, code beautification and the likes. This project will be the first open-sourced client running on the protocol for Vanis.io, without the BS. 

## FAQ:

#### Can I make bots with the authentication in this client?
> Yes you can, however please note that the Vanis protocol has other methods of security (*cough* banning public proxies, detecting unusual client behaviour, etc)

#### How can I use this?
> This project can help you develop your own extensions or built-in macros for gameplay advantage. The possiblities are endless as this project unlocks normally restricted client access, and open-sources a lot of previously minified & undocumented code.

#### Can this be patched?
> Yes, of course. However I will keep this project maintained and up-to-date for as long as it is possible to do so.
